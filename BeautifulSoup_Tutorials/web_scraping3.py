# Goal of this section, want to get the elements in tbody
# Imports
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

url = "https://coinmarketcap.com/" # define url to be searched
result = requests.get(url).text # use request module to list url content as text to be parsed
doc = BeautifulSoup(result, "html.parser") # parse url text using BS4s HTML parser

tbody = doc.tbody
#print(tbody)

# Want to navigate by viewing the elements on the same level of the html tree
# could get all the contents of <tbody> and loop through
# in this case, want to navigate by looking through the siblings of each row in the tbody element

trs = tbody.contents # gives a list of all the tags in tbody (table rows)
#print(trs)

print(trs[0].next_sibling) # print the next entry / sibling down from trs[0]
print(trs[1].previous_sibling) # print previous sibling
print(list(trs[0].next_siblings)) # list all the table rows after tr[0]

# parents
print(trs[0].parent) # get parent tag to trs
print(trs[0].parent.name) # get name of parent tag to trs
print(list(trs[0].descendants)) # get descendants of trs, in this case the table data
                                # could also use .contents or .children, latter gives tags only

prices = {} # define empty dictionary to be added
for tr in trs[:10]: # for each entry in table rows (trs) up to 10th entry (would need to deal with "none" situations in future scenarios e.g look for a dollar sign and work from there)
    name, price =  tr.contents[2:4] # want to get just the name and price
    fixed_name = name.p.string
    print(fixed_name) # name is inside of a p tag, so can just get that and print the string
    fixed_price = price.a.string
    print(fixed_price) # price in <a> tag, get string

    prices[fixed_name] = fixed_price # append to prices {} with key being fixed name and value being fixed prices

print(prices)
